## 🌟 About Cogno Solution

Cogno Solution is an innovative, AI-powered web platform designed to bridge the gap between healthcare professionals and children with learning disabilities. Our platform serves as a comprehensive therapeutic tool that enables doctors to monitor patient progress while providing engaging, evidence-based interventions for children with cognitive challenges.

### 🔬 Research Foundation
Our platform is built on extensive ground research conducted at **Saksham Autism Foundation, Wagholi, Pune** - a leading institution working with autism and related mental health conditions. Through direct observation and collaboration with therapists, educators, and families, we identified the critical need for a technology-driven solution that could:

- Provide consistent therapy outside clinical settings
- Enable remote monitoring of patient progress
- Gamify learning to increase engagement
- Offer data-driven insights for treatment optimization

## 🎯 Why These Four Learning Disabilities?

Our platform focuses on **Dyslexia**, **Dyscalculia**, **Dysgraphia**, and **Dyspraxia** because research indicates these are the most prevalent learning disabilities among children and adolescents:

| Disability | Prevalence | Primary Impact | Age of Detection |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Dyslexia** | 5-10% of population | Reading, language processing | 6-8 years |
| **Dyscalculia** | 3-6% of population | Mathematical reasoning | 7-9 years |
| **Dysgraphia** | 2-8% of population | Writing, fine motor skills | 5-7 years |
| **Dyspraxia** | 2-6% of population | Motor coordination | 3-6 years |

These conditions often co-occur and significantly impact academic performance, making early intervention crucial for optimal outcomes.
